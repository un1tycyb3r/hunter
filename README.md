# hunter

Hunter is my script that I have based off of the script from TCM Security's Ethical Hacker course, but modified for my own uses. 

It utilizes a variety of tools by TomNomNom, Project Discovery, and others.

The basic flow of the script is this:

## Find Subs with assetfinder, amass, subfinder and github-subdomains

## Verify subs with httprobe ( I might switch this to HTTPX...idk)

## Find open ports using Naabu and using the nmap cli functionality to run a service scan

## Scrape data using Gau (params, interesting files [.js, .jsp, aspx, etc.])

## Take screenshots with eyewitness

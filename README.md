# hunter

Hunter is my group of recon automation scripts

The order of the scripts:

1. domains.sh
2. shosubgo.sh
3. github.sh
4. ips.sh
5. naabu.sh
6. brute.sh
7. alt.sh
8. webservers.sh

Run ``` python3 recon.py ``` and grab a cup of coffee

Currently don't have a python wrapper for the webserver enumeration. Working on it.


# Coming soon

1. Python wrapper script for recon execution -- Done
2. spidering script for an initial spider of the webservers
